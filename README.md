mechanize_code_challenge
========================

Your challenge, should you accept it, is to create a script that scrapes a jobs board to find out if they have internship positions open. Naturally, a very abstract, unhelpful code challenge. :)

Here are a couple links:

* [Crowd Compass](http://www.crowdcompass.com/careers/)
* [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/about/jobs)
* [Puppet Labs](https://puppetlabs.com/company/careers/)

At least 2 of those links are much harder to scrape than the other two. 

## Process

### Step 1

* Fork and clone this repo
* Create your code with tests
* Send me a pull request

### Step 2

* Create a branch called squishy
* Make your code as small as possible (yay golfing!)
* Push your code and make a second pull request
